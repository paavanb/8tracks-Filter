8tracks-Filter
==============

This [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/8tracks-filter/mfnckojeldhblmahadnhldhkjlnopbmo) 
filters out mix covers from the 8tracks website.

I enjoy listening to 8tracks at work, but I noticed that many mix covers on the site are NSFW. 
The "SFW browsing mode" isn't particularly helpful because mixes that are flagged as NSFW are hidden completely, and
in my experience most NSFW mixes aren't flagged at all.

I created this extension so that I could listen to great music without plastering my screen with questionable cover art!
